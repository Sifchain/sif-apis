# Contribution Guidelines

## Make A Branch
- Create a separate branch for each issue that you're working on. 
- Do not make changes to the default branch (e.g. master, develop) of your fork
- Branches must have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/latency_issue` or `feature/add_claimable_tokens`.
- Your pull request must not target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.


## Commits:
Make sure you have a descriptive commit message with a short title

## Last but not least
- Follow the [pull_request_template.md](https://github.com/Sifchain/sif-apis/blob/master/pull_request_template.md) , and mark the checklist by adding an x in the [ ] e.g. [x]
- Give a descriptive title to your PR.
